# Traffic-Accident-Data-Analysis-With-R
We analyzed traffic accident data obtained from Georgia in this project. We transformed these analyses into an R Shiny App. The application allows filtering accident locations by dates, selecting variables in plots as desired, and includes a hypothesis analysis for determining the preferred route for an ambulance.
